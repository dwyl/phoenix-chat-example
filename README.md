## Why?

Chat apps are the 
[`"Hello World"`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) 
of 
[real time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing)
examples. <br />

Sadly, **_most_ example apps** show a few **basics**
and then **ignore the rest** ... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è<br />
So **beginners** are often left **lost** or **confused** as to
what they should _do_ or learn _next_! <br />
Very _few_ tutorials consider 
**Testing, Deployment, Documentation** or _other_ "**Enhancements**" 
which are all part of the "***Real World***" 
of building and running apps;
so those are topics we **_will_ cover** to "_fill in the gaps_".

We wrote _this_ tutorial to be **_easiest_ way to learn `Phoenix`**,
`Ecto` and `Channels` with a **_practical_ example _anyone_ can follow**.

This is the example/tutorial we _wished_ we had 
when we were learning `Elixir`, `Phoenix` ...
If you find it useful, please ‚≠ê üôè Thanks!


## What?

A simple step-by-step tutorial showing you how to:

+ **Create** a **Phoenix App** from _scratch_
(_using the `mix phx.new chat` "generator" command_)
+ Add a "Channel" so your app can communicate over 
  [**WebSockets**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket).
+ Implement a _basic_ ***front-end*** in _plain_ JavaScript
(_ES5 without any libraries_) to interact with Phoenix
(_send/receive messages via WebSockets_)
+ Add a simple "**Ecto**" **schema** to define
the **Database Table** (_to store messages_)
+ **Write** the functions ("CRUD") to _save_
message/sender data to a database table.
+ **Test** that everything is working as expected.
+ ***Deploy*** to **`Fly.io`** so you can _show_ people your creation!

_Initially_, we _deliberately_ skip over configuration files
and "_Phoenix Internals_"
because you (_beginners_) _don't need_ to know about them to get _started_.
But don't worry, we will return to them when _needed_.
We favour "_just-in-time_" (_when you need it_) learning
as it's _immediately_ obvious and _practical_ ***why***
we are learning something.


## Who?

This example is for ***complete beginners***
as a "***My First Phoenix***" App. <br />

We try to _assume_ as little as possible,
but if you think we "_skipped a step_"
or  you feel "_stuck_" for any reason,
or have _any_ questions (_related to this example_),
please open an issue on GitHub! <br />
Both the @dwyl and Phoenix communities are _super **beginner-friendly**_,
so don't be afraid/shy. <br />
Also, by asking questions, you are helping everyone
that is or might be stuck with the _same_ thing!

# _How_?

These instructions show you how to _create_ the Chat app
_from scratch_.
<!--
If you prefer to _run_ the existing/sample app,
scroll down to the "Clone Repo and Run on Localhost" section instead.
-->

## 0. Pre-requisites (_Before you Start_)

1. **Elixir _Installed_** on your **local machine**. <br />
see: 
[dwyl/learn-elixir#**installation**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elixir#installation) <br />
e.g:

```sh
brew install elixir
```
> _**Note**: if you already have `Elixir` installed on your Mac,
  and just want to upgrade to the latest version, run:_
  **`brew upgrade elixir`**


1. **Phoenix** framework **installed**.
see: 
[hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html) <br />
e.g:

```sh
mix archive.install hex phx_new
```

1. PostgreSQL (Database Server) installed (_to save chat messages_) <br />
see: 
[dwyl/**learn-postgresql#installation**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-postgresql#installation)

<!-- update instructions to https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html -->

1. Basic **Elixir Syntax** knowledge will help,<br />
please see:
[dwyl/**learn-elixir**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elixir)

1. Basic **JavaScript** knowledge is _advantageous_
(_but not essential as the "front-end" code
is quite basic and well-commented_).
see: 
[dwyl/Javascript-the-Good-Parts-notes](https://github.com/dwyl/Javascript-the-Good-Parts-notes)


### _Check_ You Have Everything _Before_ Starting

Check you have the _latest version_ of **Elixir**
(_run the following command in your terminal_):

```sh
elixir -v
```

You should see something like:

```sh
Erlang/OTP 25 [erts-13.1.1] [source] [64-bit] [smp:10:10] [ds:10:10:10] [async-threads:1] [jit] [dtrace]

Elixir 1.14.1 (compiled with Erlang/OTP 25)
```

Check you have the **latest** version of **Phoenix**:

```sh
mix phx.new -v
```

You should see:

```sh
Phoenix installer v1.7.0-rc.2
```

> **Note**: if your `Phoenix` version is _newer_,
> Please feel free to update this doc! üìù
> We try our best to keep it updated ...
> but _your_ contributions are always welcome!

> In this tutorial, 
> we are using 
> [Phoenix 1.7-rc2](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#170-rc2-2023-01-13),
> the second release candidate 
> for `Phoenix 1.7`.
> At the time of writing, 
> if you install Phoenix,
> the *latest stable version* is not `v1.7`.
> To use this version,
> follow the official guide (don't worry, it's just running one command!)
> -> https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/phoenix-1.7-released
> 
> However, if you are reading this after its release,
> `v1.7` will be installed for you, 
> and you should see
> `Phoenix installer v1.7.0`
> in your terminal.


_Confirm_ **PostgreSQL** is running (_so the App can store chat messages_)
run the following command:

```sh
lsof -i :5432
```

You should see output _similar_ to the following:

```sh
COMMAND  PID  USER   FD  TYPE DEVICE                  SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
postgres 529 Nelson  5u  IPv6 0xbc5d729e529f062b      0t0  TCP localhost:postgresql (LISTEN)
postgres 529 Nelson  6u  IPv4 0xbc5d729e55a89a13      0t0  TCP localhost:postgresql (LISTEN)
```

This tells us that PostgreSQL is "_listening_" on TCP Port `5432`
(_the default port_)

If the `lsof` command does not yield any result
in your terminal,
run:

```sh
pg_isready
```

It should print the following:

```sh
/tmp:5432 - accepting connections
```

With all those 
["pre-flight checks"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preflight_checklist) 
performed, let's _fly_! üöÄ

<br />

## First _Run_ the _Finished_ App

_Before_ you attempt to build the Chat App from scratch,
clone and run the _finished_ working version
to get an idea of what to expect.

### Clone the Project:

In your terminal run the following command to clone the repo:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:dwyl/phoenix-chat-example.git
```

### Install the Dependencies

Change into the `phoenix-chat-example` directory
and install both the `Elixir` and `Node.js` dependencies
with this command:

```sh
cd phoenix-chat-example
mix setup
```

<!-- ### TODO: Add auth step? -->


### Run the App

Run the Phoenix app with the command:

```sh
mix phx.server
```

If you open the app
[localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
in two more web browsers,
you can see the chat messages
displayed in all of them
as soon as you hit the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key:

![phoenix-chat-example-tailwind-ui-with-auth](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/204945771-fa4f4c2a-b055-4ef2-93f0-fe0c6b8f4466.gif)

<br />

Now that you have confirmed that the _finished_
phoenix chat app works on your machine,
it's time to _build_ it from scratch!

Change directory:

```sh
cd ..
```

And start building!


<br />

## 1. _Create_ The _App_

In your terminal program on your localhost,
type the following command to create the app:

```sh
mix phx.new chat --no-mailer --no-dashboard --no-gettext
```
That will create the directory structure and project files. <br />

> We are running the 
> [`mix phx.new` command](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Mix.Tasks.Phx.New.html)
> with the `--no-mailer` `--no-dashboard` `--no-gettext` arguments
> because we don't want our project
> to generate mailer files, 
> to include a `Phoenix.LiveDashboard` 
> and generate `gettext` files 
> (for [`i18n`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization)).

When asked to "***Fetch and install dependencies***? [Yn]",<br />
Type <kbd>Y</kbd> in your terminal,
followed by the <kbd>Enter</kbd> (<kbd>Return</kbd>) key.

You should see: <br />
![fetch-and-install-dependencies](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/34833220-d219221c-f6e6-11e7-88d6-87aa4c3054e4.png)

Change directory into the `chat` directory by running the suggested command:
```sh
cd chat
```

Now run the following command:

```sh
mix setup
```

> _**Note**: at this point there is already an "App"
it just does not **do** anything (yet) ... <br />
you **can** run `mix phx.server`
in your terminal - don't worry if you're seeing error <br />
messages, this is because we haven't created our database yet. <br />
We will take care of that in [step 6](#6-createconfigure-database)!<br />
For now, open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
in your browser <br />
and you will see the `default`
"Welcome to Phoenix" homepage:_ <br />

![welcome-to-phoenix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/216576178-a227a6ef-ad12-4b74-9b29-4913b5e298bc.png)

Shut down the Phoenix server in your terminal
with the
<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>
command.

### Run the Tests

In your terminal window, run the following command:

```
mix test
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```sh
Generated chat app
.....
Finished in 0.02 seconds (0.02s async, 0.00s sync)
5 tests, 0 failures

Randomized with seed 84184
```

Now that we have confirmed that everything is working (all tests pass),
let's continue to the _interesting_ part!

<br />

## 2. _Create_ the (WebSocket) "_Channel_"

Generate the (WebSocket) channel to be used in the chat app:

```sh
mix phx.gen.channel Room
```

> If you are prompted to confirm installation of a new socket handler
type `y` and hit the `[Enter]` key.

This will create **three files**:<br />

```sh
* creating lib/chat_web/channels/room_channel.ex
* creating test/chat_web/channels/room_channel_test.exs
* creating test/support/channel_case.ex
```

in addition to creating **two more files**:
```sh
* creating lib/chat_web/channels/user_socket.ex
* creating assets/js/user_socket.js
```


The `room_channel.ex` file handles receiving/sending messages
and the `room_channel_test.exs` tests basic interaction with the channel.
We'll focus on the `socket` files created afterwards.
(_Don't worry about this yet, we will look at the test file in step 14 below_!)

We are informed that we need to update a piece of code in our app:
```sh
Add the socket handler to your `lib/chat_web/endpoint.ex`, for example:

    socket "/socket", ChatWeb.UserSocket,
      websocket: true,
      longpoll: false

For the front-end integration, you need to import the `user_socket.js`
in your `assets/js/app.js` file:

    import "./user_socket.js"
```

The generator asks us to import the client code in the frontend.
Let's do that later. For now, open the `lib/chat_web/endpoint.ex` file and follow the instructions.

After this, open the file called `/lib/chat_web/channels/user_socket.ex` <br >
and change the line:

```elixir
channel "room:*", ChatWeb.RoomChannel
```

to:

```elixir
channel "room:lobby", ChatWeb.RoomChannel
```

Check the change [here](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-chat-example/blob/0faa7f18ea6d7790e027ace5147cd1740040a75e/lib/chat_web/channels/user_socket.ex#L11).

This will ensure that whatever messages that are sent to `"room:lobby"` are routed to our `RoomChannel`.

The previous `"room.*` meant that any subtopic within `"room"` were routed. 
But for now, let's narrow down to just one subtopic :smile:.

> For more detail on Phoenix Channels,
(_we highly recommend you_) read:
https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/channels.html


<br />

## 3. Update the Template File (UI)

Open the the
[`/lib/chat_web/controllers/page_html/home.html.heex`](/lib/chat_web/controllers/page_html/home.html.heex)
file <br />
and _copy-paste_ (_or type_) the following code:

```html
<!-- The list of messages will appear here: -->
<div class="mt-[4rem]">
  <ul id="msg-list" phx-update="stream" class="pa-1"></ul>
</div>

<footer class="bg-slate-800 p-2 h-[3rem] fixed bottom-0 w-full flex justify-center">
  <div class="w-full flex flex-row items-center text-gray-700 focus:outline-none font-normal">
    <input type="text" id="name" placeholder="Name" required
        class="grow-0 w-1/6 px-1.5 py-1.5"/>

    <input type="text" id="msg" placeholder="Your message" required
      class="grow w-2/3 mx-1 px-2 py-1.5"/>

    <button id="send" class="text-white bold rounded px-3 py-1.5 w-fit
        transition-colors duration-150 bg-sky-500 hover:bg-sky-600">
      Send
    </button>
  </div>
</footer>

```

This is the _basic_ form we will use to input Chat messages. <br />
The classes e.g. `w-full` and `items-center`
are [`TailwindCSS`](https://tailwindcss.com/)
classes to _style_ the form. <br />
Phoenix includes Tailwind by default so you can get up-and-running
with your App/Idea/"MVP"! <br />

> If you're new to `Tailwind`,
please see: 
[dwyl/**learn-tailwind**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tailwind)
> 
> If you have questions about any 
of the **`Tailwind`** classes used,
please spend 2 mins Googling 
or searching the official (superb!) docs:
[tailwindcss.com/docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) 
and then if you're still stuck, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tailwind/issues).

Your `home.html.heex` template file should look like this:
[`/lib/chat_web/controllers/page_html/home.html.heex`](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-chat-example/blob/6d070dd27a69572cca6e35f0703aa535c0201a3c/lib/chat_web/controllers/page_html/home.html.heex)


### 3.1 Update Layout Template

Open the `lib/chat_web/components/layouts/root.html.heex` file
and locate the `<body>` tag.
Replace the contents of the `<body>` with the following code:

```html
  <body class="bg-white antialiased min-h-screen flex flex-col">
    <header class="bg-slate-800 w-full h-[4rem] top-0 fixed flex flex-col justify-center z-10">
      <div class="flex flex-row justify-center items-center">
        <h1 class="w-4/5 md:text-3xl text-center font-mono text-white">
          Phoenix Chat Example
        </h1>
      </div>
    </header>
    <%= @inner_content %>
  </body>
```

Your `root.html.heex` template file should look like this:
[`/lib/chat_web/components/layouts/root.html.heex`](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-chat-example/blob/6d070dd27a69572cca6e35f0703aa535c0201a3c/lib/chat_web/components/layouts/root.html.heex)

At the end of this step, if you run the Phoenix Server `mix phx.server`,
and view the App in your browser it will look like this:

![phoenix-chat-blank](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/216590189-95923e9a-0956-4468-be8b-63b986d32f14.png)

So it's already starting to look like a basic Chat App.
Sadly, since we changed the copy of the `home.html.heex`
our `page_controller_test.exs` now fails:

Run the command:

```sh
mix test
```

```
1) test GET / (ChatWeb.PageControllerTest)
     test/chat_web/controllers/page_controller_test.exs:4
     Assertion with =~ failed
     code:  assert html_response(conn, 200) =~ "Peace of mind from prototype to production"
```

Thankfully this is easy to fix.


### 3.2 Update the `page_controller_test.exs`

Open the `test/chat_web/controllers/page_controller_test.exs` file
and replace the line:

```elixir
    assert html_response(conn, 200) =~ "Peace of mind from prototype to production"
```

With:

```elixir
    assert html_response(conn, 200) =~ "Phoenix Chat Example"
```

Now if you run the tests again, they will pass:
```
mix test
```

Sample output:

```
........
Finished in 0.1 seconds (0.09s async, 0.06s sync)
8 tests, 0 failures

Randomized with seed 275786
```

<br />

## 4. Update the "Client" code in App.js

Open
`assets/js/app.js`,
uncomment and change the line:

```js
import socket from "./user_socket.js"
```

With the line _uncommented_,
our app will import the `socket.js` file
which will give us WebSocket functionality.

Then add the following JavaScript ("Client") code
to the bottom of the file:

```js
/* Message list code */
const ul = document.getElementById('msg-list');    // list of messages.
const name = document.getElementById('name');      // name of message sender
const msg = document.getElementById('msg');        // message input field
const send = document.getElementById('send');      // send button

const channel = socket.channel('room:lobby', {});  // connect to chat "room"
channel.join(); // join the channel.

// Listening to 'shout' events
channel.on('shout', function (payload) {
  render_message(payload)
});


// Send the message to the server on "shout" channel
function sendMessage() {

  channel.push('shout', {        
    name: name.value || "guest", // get value of "name" of person sending the message. Set guest as default
    message: msg.value,          // get message text (value) from msg input field.
    inserted_at: new Date()      // date + time of when the message was sent
  });

  msg.value = '';                // reset the message input field for next message.
  window.scrollTo(0, document.documentElement.scrollHeight) // scroll to the end of the page on send
}

// Render the message with Tailwind styles
function render_message(payload) {

  const li = document.createElement("li"); // create new list item DOM element

  // Message HTML with Tailwind CSS Classes for layout/style:
  li.innerHTML = `
  <div class="flex flex-row w-[95%] mx-2 border-b-[1px] border-slate-300 py-2">
    <div class="text-left w-1/5 font-semibold text-slate-800 break-words">
      ${payload.name}
      <div class="text-xs mr-1">
        <span class="font-thin">${formatDate(payload.inserted_at)}</span> 
        <span>${formatTime(payload.inserted_at)}</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="flex w-3/5 mx-1 grow">
      ${payload.message}
    </div>
  </div>
  `
  // Append to list
  ul.appendChild(li);
}

// Listen for the [Enter] keypress event to send a message:
msg.addEventListener('keypress', function (event) {
  if (event.key === `Enter` && msg.value.length > 0) { // don't sent empty msg.
    sendMessage()
  }
});

// On "Send" button press
send.addEventListener('click', function (event) {
  if (msg.value.length > 0) { // don't sent empty msg.
    sendMessage()
  }
});

// Date formatting
function formatDate(datetime) {
  const m = new Date(datetime);
  return m.getUTCFullYear() + "/" 
    + ("0" + (m.getUTCMonth()+1)).slice(-2) + "/" 
    + ("0" + m.getUTCDate()).slice(-2);
}

// Time formatting
function formatTime(datetime) {
  const m = new Date(datetime);
  return ("0" + m.getUTCHours()).slice(-2) + ":"
    + ("0" + m.getUTCMinutes()).slice(-2) + ":"
    + ("0" + m.getUTCSeconds()).slice(-2);
}
```

> Take a moment to read the JavaScript code
and confirm your understanding of what it's doing. <br />
Hopefully the in-line comments are self-explanatory,
but if _anything_ is unclear, please ask!

At this point your `app.js` file should look like this:
[`/assets/js/app.js`](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-chat-example/blob/f45afee52570e07d43b7e3652564d24857a32bd7/assets/js/app.js)


### 4.1 Comment Out Lines in `user_socket.js`

By default the phoenix channel (client)
will subscribe to the generic room: `"topic:subtopic"`.
Since we aren't going to be using this,
we can avoid seeing any
**`"unable to join: unmatched topic"`** errors in our browser/console
by simply commenting out a few lines in the `user_socket.js` file.
Open the file in your editor and locate the following lines:

```JavaScript
let channel = socket.channel("room:42", {})
channel.join()
  .receive("ok", resp => { console.log("Joined successfully", resp) })
  .receive("error", resp => { console.log("Unable to join", resp) })
```
Comment out the lines so they will not be executed:

```JavaScript
//let channel = socket.channel("room:42", {})
//channel.join()
//  .receive("ok", resp => { console.log("Joined successfully", resp) })
//  .receive("error", resp => { console.log("Unable to join", resp) })
```

Your `user_socket.js` should now look like this:
[`/assets/js/user_socket.js`](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-chat-example/blob/f45afee52570e07d43b7e3652564d24857a32bd7/assets/js/user_socket.js)

> If you later decide to tidy up your chat app, you can **`delete`**
these commented lines from the file. <br />
We are just keeping them for reference
of how to join channels and receive messages.

If you are running the app,
try to fill the `name` and `message` fields
and click `Enter` (or press `Send`).

The message should appear
on different windows!

<img width="905" alt="ephemeral_chat" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/216594102-f39af9c2-25c2-45f0-97bb-feecc434be5a.png">

With this done, we can proceed.

<br />


### Storing Chat Message Data/History

If we didn't _want_ to _save_ the chat history,
we could just _deploy_ this App _immediately_
and we'd be done! <br />

> In fact, it could be a "_use-case_" / "_feature_"
to have "_ephemeral_" chat without _any_ history ...
> see: http://www.psstchat.com/.
![psst-chat](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/35284714-6e338596-0053-11e8-998a-83b917ec90ae.png)
> 
> But we are _assuming_ that _most_ chat apps save history
> so that `new` people joining the "channel" can see the history
> and people who are briefly "absent" can "catch up" on the history.

<br />

## 5. Generate Database Schema to Store Chat History

Run the following command in your terminal:
```sh
mix phx.gen.schema Message messages name:string message:string
```
You should see the following output:
```sh
* creating lib/chat/message.ex
* creating priv/repo/migrations/20230203114114_create_messages.exs

Remember to update your repository by running migrations:

    $ mix ecto.migrate
```

Let's break down that command for clarity:
+ `mix phx.gen.schema` - the mix command to create a new schema (database table)
+ `Message` - the singular name for record in our messages "collection"
+ `messages` - the name of the collection (_or database table_)
+ `name:string` - the name of the person sending a message, stored as a `string`.
+ `message:string` - the message sent by the person, also stored as a `string`.

The line `creating lib/chat/message.ex` creates the "schema"
for our Message database table.

Additionally a migration file is created, e.g:
`creating priv/repo/migrations/20230203114114_create_messages.exs`
The "_migration_" actually _creates_ the database table in our database.

<br />

## 6. Run the Ecto Migration (_Create The Database Table_)

In your terminal run the following command to create the `messages` table:

```sh
mix ecto.migrate
```

> For _context_  we recommend reading:
[hexdocs.pm/ecto_sql/**Ecto.Migration**.html](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto_sql/Ecto.Migration.html)

You should see the following in your terminal:
```sh
11:42:10.130 [info] == Running 20230203114114 Chat.Repo.Migrations.CreateMessages.change/0 forward

11:42:10.137 [info] create table messages

11:42:10.144 [info] == Migrated 20230203114114 in 0.0s
```

<br />

### 6.1 Review the Messages Table Schema

If you open your PostgreSQL GUI (_e.g: [pgadmin](https://www.pgadmin.org)_)
you will see that the messages table has been created
in the `chat_dev` database:

![pgadmin-messages-table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/35624169-deaa7fd4-0696-11e8-8dd0-584eba3a2037.png)

You can view the table schema by "_right-clicking_" (_`ctrl + click` on Mac_)
on the `messages` table and selecting "properties":

![pgadmin-messages-schema-columns-view](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/35623295-c3a4df5c-0693-11e8-8484-199c2bcab458.png)

> _**Note**: For sections 7, 8, and 9 we will be fleshing out how our code
> "handles" the different events that can occur in our chat app._
>
> _Phoenix abstracts away much of the underlying message-passing logic in
> Elixir's process communication (for more info on how Elixir processes
> communicate, read [here](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/processes.html))._
>
> _In Phoenix, events/messages sent from the client are automatically
> routed to the corresponding handler functions based on the event name,
> making message handling seamless and straightforward!._

<br />

## 7. Insert Messages into Database

Open the `lib/chat_web/channels/room_channel.ex` file
and inside the function `def handle_in("shout", payload, socket) do`
add the following line:
```elixir
Chat.Message.changeset(%Chat.Message{}, payload) |> Chat.Repo.insert  
```

So that your function ends up looking like this:
```elixir
def handle_in("shout", payload, socket) do
  Chat.Message.changeset(%Chat.Message{}, payload) |> Chat.Repo.insert  
  broadcast socket, "shout", payload
  {:noreply, socket}
end
```

If you noticed earlier, in our `assets/js/app.js` file, we used the function 
`sendMessage()` to *push* our message to the server on the "shout" event. 

Phoenix routes the message to the server-side
`handle_in("shout", payload, socket)` function because the event name 
matches 'shout'. 

In this function, we handle the payload (which is the message text and
any other data) and insert it into our database. _Neat!_

<br />


## 8. Load _Existing_ Messages (_When Someone Joins the Chat_)

Open the `lib/chat/message.ex` file and import `Ecto.Query`:

```elixir
defmodule Chat.Message do
  use Ecto.Schema
  import Ecto.Changeset
  import Ecto.Query # add Ecto.Query

```

Then add a new function to it:

```elixir
def get_messages(limit \\ 20) do
  Chat.Message
  |> limit(^limit)
  |> order_by(desc: :inserted_at)
  |> Chat.Repo.all()
end
```
This function accepts a single parameter `limit` to only return a fixed/maximum
number of records.
It uses Ecto's `all` function to fetch all records from the database.
`Message` is the name of the schema/table we want to get records for,
and limit is the maximum number of records to fetch.

<br />

## 9. Send Existing Messages to the Client when they Join

In the `/lib/chat_web/channels/room_channel.ex` file create a new function:
```elixir
@impl true
def handle_info(:after_join, socket) do
  Chat.Message.get_messages()
  |> Enum.reverse() # revers to display the latest message at the bottom of the page
  |> Enum.each(fn msg -> push(socket, "shout", %{
      name: msg.name,
      message: msg.message,
      inserted_at: msg.inserted_at,
    }) end)
  {:noreply, socket} # :noreply
end
```

and at the top of the file update the `join` function to the following:

```elixir
def join("room:lobby", payload, socket) do
  if authorized?(payload) do
    send(self(), :after_join)
    {:ok, socket}
  else
    {:error, %{reason: "unauthorized"}}
  end
end
```

> _**Note**: like section 7, Phoenix knows to call this function when the server
> sends the internal message `:after_join` via the channel process._
>
> _Our `join/3` function in `lib/chat_web/channels/room_channel.ex` sends
> that `:after_join message` to the channel process when the client successfully
> connects to the `"room:lobby"` topic._

<br />


## 10. _Checkpoint_: Our Chat App Saves Messages!! (_Try it_!)

Start the Phoenix server (_if it is not already running_):
```sh
mix phx.server
```

> _**Note**: it will take a few seconds to **compile**_.


In your terminal, you should see:
```sh
[info] Running ChatWeb.Endpoint with cowboy 2.8.0 at 0.0.0.0:4000 (http)
[info] Access ChatWeb.Endpoint at http://localhost:4000

webpack is watching the files‚Ä¶
```

This tells us that our code compiled (_as expected_) and the Chat App
is running on TCP Port `4000`!

**Open** the Chat web app in
**two _separate_ browser windows**: http://localhost:4000 <br />
(_if your machine only has one browser try using one "incognito" tab_)

You should be able to send messages between the two browser windows: <br />
![phoenix-chat-example-basic-cropped](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/216617288-31ab0fbf-9b0e-456f-995a-bfb8499e8847.gif)

Congratulations! You have a _working_ (_basic_) Chat App written in Phoenix!

The chat (message) history is _saved_!

This means you can _refresh_ the browser
_or_ join in a different browser and you will still see the history!

<br />

# Testing our App (_Automated Testing_)

Automated testing is one of the _best_ ways to ensure _reliability_
in your web applications.

> _**Note**: If you are completely new to Automated Testing
or "Test Driven Development" ("TDD"),
we recommend reading/following the "basic" tutorial:_
[github.com/dwyl/**learn-tdd**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tdd)

Testing in Phoenix is fast (_tests run in parallel!_)
and easy to get started!
The `ExUnit` testing framework is _built-in_
so there aren't an "decisions/debates"
about which framework or style to use.

If you have never seen or written a test with `ExUnit`,
don't fear, the syntax should be _familiar_ if you have
written _any_ sort of automated test in the past.

<br />

## 11. Run the Default/Generated Tests

Whenever you create a new Phoenix app
or add a new feature (_like a channel_),
Phoenix _generates_ a new test for you.

We _run_ the tests using the **`mix test`** command:

```elixir
........
Finished in 0.1 seconds (0.05s async, 0.06s sync)
8 tests, 0 failures

Randomized with seed 157426
```

In this case _none_ of these tests fails. (_8 tests, **0 failure**_)


## 12. Understanding The Channel Tests

It's worth taking a moment (_or as long as you need_!)
to _understand_ what is going on in the
[`/room_channel_test.exs`](/test/chat_web/channels/room_channel_test.exs)
file. _Open_ it if you have not already, read the test descriptions & code.

> For a bit of _context_ we recommend reading:
[https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/**testing_channels**.html](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/testing_channels.html)

### 12.1 _Analyse_ a Test

Let's take a look at the _first_ test in
[/test/chat_web/channels/room_channel_test.exs](/test/chat_web/channels/room_channel_test.exs#L14-L17):

```elixir
test "ping replies with status ok", %{socket: socket} do
  ref = push socket, "ping", %{"hello" => "there"}
  assert_reply ref, :ok, %{"hello" => "there"}
end
```
The test gets the `socket` from the `setup` function (_on line 6 of the file_)
and assigns the result of calling the `push` function to a variable `ref`
`push` merely _pushes_ a message (_the map `%{"hello" => "there"}`_)
on the `socket` to the `"ping"` ***topic***.

The [`handle_in`](https://github.com/nelsonic/phoenix-chat-example/blob/f3823e64d9f9826db67f5cdf228ea5c974ad59fa/lib/chat_web/channels/room_channel.ex#L12-L16)
function clause which handles the `"ping"` topic:

```elixir
def handle_in("ping", payload, socket) do
  {:reply, {:ok, payload}, socket}
end
```
Simply _replies_ with the payload you send it,
therefore in our _test_ we can use the `assert_reply` Macro
to assert that the `ref` is equal to `:ok, %{"hello" => "there"}`

> _**Note**: if you have questions or need **any** help
understanding the other tests, please open an issue on GitHub
we are happy to expand this further!_ <br />
(_we are just trying to keep this tutorial reasonably "brief"
so beginners are not "overwhelmed" by anything...)_

<br />

## 13. What is _Not_ Tested?

_Often_ we can learn a _lot_ about an application (_or API_)
from reading the tests and seeing where the "gaps" in testing are.

_Thankfully_ we can achieve this with only a couple of steps:

<br />

### 13.1 Add `excoveralls` as a (Development) Dependency to `mix.exs`

Open your `mix.exs` file and find the "deps" function:
```elixir
defp deps do
```

Add a comma to the end of the last line, then add the following line to the end
of the List:
```elixir
{:excoveralls, "~> 0.15.2", only: [:test, :dev]} # tracking test coverage
```

Additionally, find the `def project do` section (_towards the top of `mix.exs`_)
and add the following lines to the List:

```elixir
test_coverage: [tool: ExCoveralls],
preferred_cli_env: [
  coveralls: :test,
  "coveralls.detail": :test,
  "coveralls.post": :test,
  "coveralls.html": :test
]
```

_Then_, ***install*** the dependency on `excoveralls`
we just added to `mix.exs`:

```sh
mix deps.get
```

You should see:

```sh
Resolving Hex dependencies...
Dependency resolution completed:
* Getting excoveralls (Hex package)
... etc.
```

### 13.2 Create a _New File_ Called `coveralls.json`

In the "root" (_base directory_) of the Chat project,
create a new file called `coveralls.json` and _copy-paste_ the following:

```json
{
  "coverage_options": {
    "minimum_coverage": 100
  },
  "skip_files": [
    "test/",
    "lib/chat/application.ex",
    "lib/chat_web.ex",
    "lib/chat_web/telemetry.ex",
    "lib/chat_web/components/core_components.ex",
    "lib/chat_web/channels/user_socket.ex"
  ]
}

```
This file is quite basic, it instructs the `coveralls` app
to require a **`minimum_coverage`** of **100%**
(_i.e. **everything is tested**<sup>1</sup>_)
and to _ignore_ the files in the `test/` directory for coverage checking.
We also ignore files such as `application.ex`,
`telemetry.ex`, `core_components.ex` and `user_socket.ex`
because they are not relevant for the functionality of our project.

> <small>_<sup>1</sup>We believe that **investing**
a little **time up-front** to write tests for **all** our **code**
is **worth it** to have **fewer bugs** later. <br />
**Bugs** are **expensive**, **tests** are **cheap**
and **confidence**/**reliability** is **priceless**_. </small>


### 13.3 Run the Tests with Coverage Checking

To run the tests with coverage, copy-paste the following command
into your terminal:

```elixir
MIX_ENV=test mix do coveralls.json
```
> For windows use:
> ```elixir
> $env:MIX_ENV="test"; mix do coveralls.json
> ```

You should see: <br />

```

```

As we can se here, only **80%** of lines of code in `/lib`
are being "covered" by the tests we have written.

To **view** the coverage in a web browser run the following:

```elixir
MIX_ENV=test mix coveralls.html ; open cover/excoveralls.html
```

<br />

This will open the Coverage Report (HTML) in your default Web Browser: <br />

<!-- I think I'm at a point where I need to take a "Detour"
to write up my **Definitive** thoughts on "Test Coverage" once-and-for-all! -->


### 13.4 Write a Test for the Untested Function

Open the `test/chat_web/channels/room_channel_test.exs` file
and add the following test:

```elixir
test ":after_join sends all existing messages", %{socket: socket} do
  # insert a new message to send in the :after_join
  payload = %{name: "Alex", message: "test"}
  Chat.Message.changeset(%Chat.Message{}, payload) |> Chat.Repo.insert()

  {:ok, _, socket2} = ChatWeb.UserSocket
    |> socket("person_id", %{some: :assign})
    |> subscribe_and_join(ChatWeb.RoomChannel, "room:lobby")

  assert socket2.join_ref != socket.join_ref
end
```

Finally, inside `lib/chat_web/router.ex`,
comment the following piece of code.

```elixir
  pipeline :api do
    plug :accepts, ["json"]
  end
```

Since we are not using this `:api` in this project,
there is no need to test it.

Now when you run `MIX_ENV=test mix do coveralls.json`
you should see:

```

[TOTAL] 100.0%
----------------
```

This test just creates a message before
the `subscribe_and_join` so there is a message in the database
to send out to any client that joins the chat.

That way the `:after_join` has at least one message
and the `Enum.each` will be invoked at least once.

With that our app is fully tested!

# Authentication

We can *extend* this project
to support basic authentication.
If you want to _understand_ 
how Authentication is implemented the _easy/fast_ way,
see:
[auth.md](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-chat-example/blob/main/auth.md)


<br />

# Adding `Presence` to track who's online

One of the great advantages
of using `Phoenix`
is that you can 
*easily track processes*
and channels.

This paves the way to *effortlessly*
showing who's online or not!

If you are interested in 
developing this feature,
we have created a guide in 
[`presence.md`](./presence.md)
just for you! üòÄ

<br />

# Continuous Integration

Continuous integration 
lets you _automate_ running the tests
to check/confirm that your app 
is working as _expected_ (_before deploying_).
This prevents accidentally "_breaking_" your app.

_Thankfully_ the steps are quite simple.

For an example `ci.yml`, see:

[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-chat-example/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml)

<br />

# Deployment!

Deployment to Fly.io takes a couple of minutes,
we recommend following the official guide:
[fly.io/docs/elixir/**getting-started**](https://fly.io/docs/elixir/getting-started/)

Once you have _deployed_ you will will be able
to view/use your app in any Web/Mobile Browser.

e.g:
[**phoenix-chat**.fly.dev/](https://phoenix-chat.fly.dev/) <br />

## Inspiration

This repo is inspired by @chrismccord's Simple Chat Example:
https://github.com/chrismccord/phoenix_chat_example ‚ù§Ô∏è

At the time of writing Chris' example was last updated on
[20 Feb 2018](https://github.com/chrismccord/phoenix_chat_example/commit/7fb1d3d040b9d1e9a1bbd239c60ca1f4dd403c24)
and uses
[Phoenix 1.3](https://github.com/chrismccord/phoenix_chat_example/blob/7fb1d3d040b9d1e9a1bbd239c60ca1f4dd403c24/mix.exs#L25)
see:
[issues/40](https://github.com/chrismccord/phoenix_chat_example/issues/40). <br />
There are quite a few differences (breaking changes)
between Phoenix 1.3 and 1.6 (_the latest version_). <br />

Our tutorial uses Phoenix `1.6.2` (latest as of October 2021).
Our hope is that by writing (_and maintaining_)
a step-by-step beginner focussed
tutorial we contribute to the Elixir/Phoenix community
without piling up
[PRs](https://github.com/chrismccord/phoenix_chat_example/pulls)
on Chris's repo.
